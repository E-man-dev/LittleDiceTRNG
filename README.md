# LittleDiceTRNG
Have a nerd friend who always complains about the dice being rigged? Don't trust the dice yourself? With the right hardware, you can solve all that! This uses an Adafruit ESP32-S2 Reverse TFT Feather, a 50 mm STEMMA QT / Qwiic JST SH 4-Pin Cable, and an Adafruit Infineon Trust M Breakout Board, as well as a little PLA and TPU for the case.
